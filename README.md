cython_test
===========

Just playing around with Cython bindings to see what a wrapper would look like.
It's not likely to go anywhere beyond what you see.

... well, maybe not. This is looking to be a viable replacement for the completely
unmaintainable SWIG-based Box2D. Stay tuned.

Work-in-progress [documentation](http://pybox2d.github.io/cython_test/)
